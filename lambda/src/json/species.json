Today, they are known for being entirely erratic, likely driven mad by the isolation of the deep tunnels in which they tinkered and toiled. When released from their claustrophobic confines and set loose on the surface, Imprits take ecstatic pleasure from using their tails to swing through the air from place to place and setting fires where they least belong.",

They attract insects with their sweet, syrupy smelling saliva and vibrant floral display, but their saliva contains a powerful sedative which paralyzes anything that it comes in contact with. In ancient times, Avililies were used by Vallerii scientists and explorers to trap insects, serving as mobile bug repellent on Florian ventures. Today, the sedative properties of their saliva have been enhanced for a far-more dangerous galaxy, and swarms of flittering Avilies protect the most sacred parts of Floria’s jungles, paralyzing and consuming all who dare to threaten the pristineness of their forests.",
